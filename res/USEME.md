Updated GUI Instructions:
- To use the image processing software, click on the load button and locate the desired image that you would like to modify.
- Once loaded, the file path should show up indicating that it was successfully loaded into the program.
  - If the brighten button at the bottom of the screen is not yet visible, resize the window by any size and it should appear.
- All available modifications are buttons displayed on the GUI layout, and you only need to click on a modification button to apply it to the current image.
  - The only modification that behaves differently is brighten, which requires an integer value in the text box next to it before clicking on the brighten button.
- Once you are satisfied with all modifications applied to the image, simply click on save and it will provide a save as window where you can save the file to your computer.
